My glory doesn't happen in front of a crowd, it doesn't happen in a stadium or on a stage. There are no medals handed out. It happens in the darkness of the early morning in solitude where I try and I try and I try again with everything I have to be the best that I can possibly be, better than I was yesterday, better than people thought I could be, better than I thought I could be. Then claim one victory that no one can ever take away from me ever. A victory that is earned every single day. A victory of determination and will and discipline. A victory achieved because I will not stop.
